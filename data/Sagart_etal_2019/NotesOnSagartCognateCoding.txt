Follow Konstantin's set up instructions here :https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftaming-the-beast.org%2Ftutorials%2FLanguagePhylogenies%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7CRobertsS55%40cardiff.ac.uk%7C5df39897a3694fa0917708d83a1492ba%7Cbdb74b3095684856bdbf06759778fcbc%7C1%7C0%7C637323207321364289&amp;sdata=VcYcwRddDpZnxORRGBcOYusoLEPAcSNiF4u867ycj4A%3D&amp;reserved=0 esp the section on birth and death rate. 

BTW: setting an origin of 90 is very high here — it’s saying that this family has been around for 90kya…. which is probably not right. Yes, the analysis should rein that in, but that depends on data and priors (blah blah), so I’d do something like:

> <parameter id="originFBD.t:tree" spec="parameter.RealParameter" lower="0.0" name="stateNode" upper=“10">9.0</parameter>    <!— or even 5 for your dataset -->
>  <prior id="originPriorFBD.t:tree" name="distribution" x="@originFBD.t:tree">
>     <Uniform id="Uniform.6" name="distr" upper=“10"/>
>   </prior>

TODO:
> Q: For the FBD, how you’ve set it up, you need to put a prior on the sampled diversity, which you haven’t.
> Er, is this the "diversificationRatePriorFBD.t:tree"? That is, just putting the prior on the diversification rate? Not sure what you mean otherwise.

This is *rho* aka “samplingProportionFBD.t:tree” in your analysis. It’s essentially a measure of how much of the total diversity you have sampled, e.g. if there are 10 languages in the clade and you’ve got samples from 5. Yes, it’s a bit of a fluffy measure, and thankfully usually doesn’t matter to much but it can help get better estimates of diversification rate (i.e. rate at which lineages split). The tutorial linked to above  talks about how we do this. Currently you’re estimating that you’ve sampled 12% of Tibetan, which feels like an under estimate to me.

Done: Glottolog lists Central Tibetan

# Questions:
I've removed 'empty' columns with all zeros or missing. But some columns have all '1's (because I'm using a small range of languges). Should I also remove these columns?

Can I add a height for the common ancestor of tibetan and old chinese, based on your full tree? This would be the root node, so I could add a prior on a monophyletic clade including all languages. I'm going off the reports of the root date in the paper, using a normal distribution (mean=7.184, sigma = 1.4, 95% = [4.88, 9.49]).

I'd like to specify a prior for the Tibetan languages to be monophyletic (i.e. mark old chinese as an out-group). I don't have a particular range of dates for this prior. I can add a prior that has all the tibetan languages in it, tick 'monophyletic', but then what model do I choose? Will it pay attention if it's "none", or should I choose a Uniform prior in the range [0,infinity], or the range [old Tibetan, root]?

In your xml file, the Data Type of the main partition is "two state covarion", but the my data is "binary". Does this matter? I suppose I'll have a different site model to you? I'm not sure how to specify the data type in the xml file I feed to Beauti. I'm currently using the BinaryCTMC template, should I switch to BinaryCovarion?

In your Beast file, you have a prior SiniticOldChineseLeaf, which sets the prior on the range for the Old Chinese tip date. However, there's no similar prior for Old Tibetan. Is that just because Old tibetan has no prior range, just a date? I see the tip date is set for Old Tibetan in the "Tip Dates" tab.
